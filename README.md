# Jenkins Hunter

Python3 script that uses a queue and threads to concurrently sweep an IP block for the port specified and then checks for unauthenticated Jenkins instances.

This can be useful for both blue and red teams. From a red team perspective, unauthenticated Jenkins hosts provide quick initial access points for attackers and this script will help find these hosts quicker. From a blue team perspective, this script can be proactively run to identify unauthenticated Jenkins and remediate them before an attacker does.

Since this script uses threading to run faster, you must first check the ulimit set on your host.

You can check the limit of the number of open file handles on your system by running:

ulimit -n

For Mac this number is often around 250. On Kali and other Linux distros this number is usually 1000+.

Since this is opens connections to ports and IPs concurrently, you'll need to set your thread number when promped accordingly.

Generally, I would recommend setting threads to 250 on Mac systems and 1000 on Kali or other Linux distros unless you follow the steps below to up the ulimit cap on your system.

Usage:

python3 jenkins-hunter.py

The enter IP block and thread count when prompted.
